              Happy birthday Chisanga Mulenga. You’re always telling me how you’ve never not shed a tear on this day. Your day. The day God set aside to craft a diamond that shines in the lives of so many. A day to set aside all the nonsense and pain that this world has given you. A day meant for you to be happy. But you say that theres always something. And that the days/events before today surely haven’t made it any easy. But I want you as someone who is special to me just as this day is special to you, to not allow the events of yesterday to over shadow the joys of this especially blessed day. The day you were born. And not just anybody, but you Chisanga Mulenga. You and I both know how happy you deserve to be and this year you do not have to deny yourself of that. Accept it and claim it because it is yours for the taking. You remember what the aim was for this year right? “To try not to cry” and that nothing should stop you from achieving that. I have faith in you and I believe in you as well. And even if that isn't possible and you do end up shedding a tear, may some of them at least be tears of joy.
              You’ve also told me what this day means to you and I’m here to remind you not to forget to look back and see how far you’ve come and all that you have achieved and all that you have learnt. 21 years older ,wiser ,hotter and nothing stopping your shine. Remember that you got this far no matter how hard things got and for that I am proud of you and everything you have attained and accomplished so far. The world would be too if it saw how far you’ve come .Be proud of yourself. All the battles you’ve fought alone in silence and come out the other end victorious, all the times you felt you’ve had it but still kept swinging on. Look within and see how much more you could be and let this day paint a bigger picture with you in it ,the light that surrounds you and everything beautiful in between . You are everything good and more. Let this day remind you that you are strong, beautiful, smart, talented, blessed , and an amazing friend and daughter I am sure. You are also the best girlfriend I could ever hope for. You are worth living and dying for plus so much more. 
              I want to remind you of how special you are to me, and that when you look in the mirror I want you to acknowledge that on this special day you were beautifully and wonderfully made. That God took hes time when he made you and he in fact paid attention to every detail, both physically and mentally. You’re attractive both in and out.
              I know you haven’t got the birthday you wanted this year but please take the time and allow yourself to enjoy everything else about this day especially yourself .I know you don’t like it when I tell you things like this.
              May this new age be graceful and full of blessing to and for you. Let everything you’ve been through both bitter and sweet be of use to you and guide you through your new age and the many more to come. I want you to know that I love you I’ll always be here for you. You’re everything I want and need. My lil sunshine. My lil mama. A cutie. A damn fine shawty. A queen. My queen. I give all the thanks and glory to God for blessing the world, this day and me with your existence.
              And do not worry, you’ll get your card and roses. I just wanted you to have something that will be timeless as well because digital roses don’t die. I’d like for you to have this where ever you go in the world and be able to read it at whatever time you like ,whenever and wherever you are to remind yourself of how loved you are and even tho on this day the sun rose and set for you , and even when the stars shine brighter and the moon is calling your name and even though it’s the most special day of your life, it’s not the only one. I know I’m not much of a poet and I’m still learning to better articulate myself, but just know that this letter comes from my heart to yours and that I love you. Now and forever, in this life and the next too. 
              I got you something but you already ruined both surprises lol so I hope this one wasn’t ruined and I hope you love it. And I promise we’ll find a cute name for our baby.
